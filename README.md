About
-----

This project is a quick starter for Node applications on Docker. We have implemented a very simple chat application with authentication (see "Resources", below) using Socket.io, Express, and MongoDB.

Strategies, credentials, and accounts
-----

This project uses [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication along with the "Username/password" strategy.

You can create a new account or regenerate a random password for an existing account by typing, on the command line:

    ./scripts/reset-password.sh some-username

User sessions are stored on disk, not in memory
-----

This means that if your appliation is restarted or crashes, you won't have to log back in.

Quickstart
-----

Install Docker and run:

    ./scripts/deploy.sh

This will give you a URL, username and password.

Now log on using the the credentials provided.

You will be able to use a simple chat application, and log out.

Let's Encrypt on a server
-----

(This does not apply to local development, only to publicly-accessible servers.)

We will follow the instructions in the following blog posts:

* [Letsencrypt HTTPS for Drupal on Docker, October 03, 2017, Dcycle Blog](https://blog.dcycle.com/blog/170a6078/letsencrypt-drupal-docker/)
* [Deploying Letsencrypt with Docker-Compose, October 06, 2017, Dcycle Blog](https://blog.dcycle.com/blog/7f3ea9e1/letsencrypt-docker-compose/)

Here are the exact steps:

* Figure out the IP address of your server, for example 1.2.3.4.
* Make sure your domain name, for example example.com, resolves to 1.2.3.4. You can test this by running:

    ping example.com

You should see something like:

    PING example.com (1.2.3.4): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 1.2.3.4: icmp_seq=0 ttl=46 time=28.269 ms
    64 bytes from 1.2.3.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=25.238 ms

Press control-C to get out of the loop.

* Run your instance (./scripts/deploy.sh)
* edit the file .env
* replace the line VIRTUAL_HOST=localhost with VIRTUAL_HOST=example.com
* Run ./scripts/deploy.sh again

If you have Let's Encrypt already set up for another project on the same server, move on to "Figure out the network name", below. Otherwise, set up Let's Encrypt as per the above blog posts:

    mkdir -p "$HOME"/certs
    docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
      --name nginx-proxy \
      -v "$HOME"/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro \
      -v /etc/nginx/vhost.d \
      -v /usr/share/nginx/html \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
      --label com.github.jrcs.letsencrypt_nginx_proxy_companion.nginx_proxy \
      --restart=always \
      jwilder/nginx-proxy
    docker run -d \
      --name nginx-letsencrypt \
      -v "$HOME"/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
      --volumes-from nginx-proxy \
      --restart=always \
      jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion

Figure out the network name

    docker network ls

It is something like "starterkit_node_default".

Connect your network and restart the Let's Encrypt container:

    docker network connect starterkit_node_default nginx-proxy
    docker restart nginx-letsencrypt

After 120 seconds the security certificate should work. Now your site should work with LetsEncrypt.

Creating new users
-----

You can run:

    ./scripts/reset-password.sh some-new-user

Adding arbitrary unique and non-unique fields, such as email addresses, to users
-----

By default users only have (and must have) a username which needs to be unique.

It is also possible to add other information to user records.

Here is an example:

By default an "admin" user exists, and we can see its record in the database by running:

    ./scripts/mongo-cli.sh
    ...
    show dbs
    use login
    show collections
    db.userInfo.find();

This will show the record associated with the user admin and potentially other users.

In a new terminal window, create a new user to demonstrate unique vs. non-unique fields:

    ./scripts/reset-password.sh some-new-user

### Adding non-unique fields to users

Back in the Mongo CLI, you will now see two users.

In yet another terminal window, open a CLI for the Node app.

    ./scripts/node-cli.sh

To add a **non-unique** field to both users, run:

    await app.c('authentication')
      .addNonUniqueFieldToUser('admin', 'hello', 'world');
    await app.c('authentication')
      .addNonUniqueFieldToUser('some-new-user', 'hello', 'world');

The same code can be used to modify an existing field. The code does nothing if the user does not exist.

You can also remove this field:

    await app.c('authentication')
      .removeFieldFromUser('admin', 'hello');
    await app.c('authentication')
      .removeFieldFromUser('some-new-user', 'hello');

### Adding unique fields to users

Back the Node CLI, you can add a unique field to the admin user:

    await app.c('authentication')
      .addUniqueFieldToUser('admin', 'hello', 'world');

Now, if you try to add the same field and value to another user, you will get an error:

    await app.c('authentication')
        .addUniqueFieldToUser('some-new-user', 'hello', 'world');
    > Uncaught:
    Error: Cannot add unique field hello to user some-new-user with value world because a different user, admin, already has that value in the same field.
        at /usr/src/app/app/authentication/index.js:154:15

### Getting a user's field value

    ./scripts/node-cli.sh
    const u = await app.c('authentication').user('admin');
    app.c('authentication').userFieldValue(u, 'view-content-permission-xyz', '0');

Sending emails
-----

Your node application can send emails using SMTP. For that you need an SMTP server. In development, we use MailHog. Here is how it works:

Start your instance using `./scripts/deploy.sh`.

Once you have a running instance you will have access to mailhog.

You can send an email by running:

   ./scripts/node-cli.js

Then, on the prompt:

    app.component('./mail/index.js').sendMailInDefaultServer({from: 'test@example.com', to: 'test@example.com', subject: 'Hello World', html: '<p>Hello</p>', text: 'Hello'}, (error, info) => { console.log(error); console.log(info); });

Then, you can run:

    docker compose ps

And visit the URL for MailHog, and you will see your message.

If you would like to use a real SMTP mail server, for production for example, then create a new file `./app/config/unversioned.yml` based on `./app/config/unversioned.example.yml`, and in the myServer section, put your actual SMTP information. The `./app/config/unversioned.example.yml` is not in version control, so you need to edit it directly on your production server.

Dcycle Node Starterkit design patterns
-----

In your own project, you are welcome to delete everything in ./app/code except ./app/code/server.js and put your own code in ./app/code/server.js.

If you are interested in keeping the structure of the current project, here are some design patterns we have used to make things easier.

### Component-based modular system

We have split our code in a series of components which are our custom node modules; they are all singleton class objects. The simplest one is ./app/code/random/index.js. It is self-contained and self explanatory; it serves to make random numbers.

You can try it by running:

    echo 'app.c("random").random()' | ./scripts/node-cli.sh

### Some components require initialization

Components like ./app/code/database/index.js require initialization before use. That is why ./app/code/server.js calls app.init() before app.run(). app.init() initializes all components that need to be initialized before the application can be run.

### Components can require dependencies at runtime

Some components, like ./app/code/chatWeb/index.js, require that other components be initiliazed before they themselves can bre initialized and eventually run.

In the case of ChatWeb, its dependency chain is as follows:

* ChatWeb depends on Express and ChatApi
* Express has no dependencies
* ChatApi depends on Express and Chat
* Chat depends on Database and BodyParser
* BodyParser depends on Express
* Database depends on Env

We use a simple dependency manager, ./app/code/dependencies/index.js, to calculate the dependency chain. You can try it at:

    echo "app.c('dependencies').getInOrder(['./chatWeb/index.js'], app);" | ./scripts/node-cli.sh

This should give you a result or ordered dependencies:

    {
      errors: [],
      results: [
        './express/index.js',
        './bodyParser/index.js',
        './env/index.js',
        './database/index.js',
        './chat/index.js',
        './chatApi/index.js',
        './chatWeb/index.js'
      ]
    }

This is used internally to initialize dependencies in the correct order. For example, in this example the database needs to be fully initialized beofre chatWeb (the web interface of our chat program) can be used.

### Defining which modules, and their configuration, to load via a yaml file

You can change which components are used by changing the yaml file ./app/config/versioned.yml, and, optionally, ./app/config/unversioned.yml, the latter being ignored in version control.

Different modules can have configuration. For example, ChatWeb needs to know on which path it should be active. That is why you will see, in ./app/config/versioned.yml, the following:

    modules:
      ...
      ./chatWeb/index.js:
        path: '/'

This tells our system that we want chatWeb to load; and, furthermore, we want to tell it that its path should be '/'. You can install the chat application on a different path if you want by changing that.

### Defining unversioned configuration for environment-specific configuration and sensitive data

Configuration can differ between environments. Here are some examples:

* The default mail server might be the included MailHog test server by default, but, on production, you'd use your own server.
* Certain components might require API keys. This can be achieved using environment variables, but you can also define unversioned configuration in ./app/config/unversioned.yml

Take a look at ./app/config/unversioned.example.yml which is an example for a file you can create called ./app/config/unversioned.example.yml.

It shows you how to change the default mail server, and include API keys if you so desire.

### Components's class names are the same as their directory names but start with an uppercase letter

For example, the class defined in ./app/code/staticPath/index.js is called StaticPath. This is more than a convention: all classes must have the same name as their directory except that they start with an uppercase letter. All our code, particularly loading plugins, depends on this.

###  Plugins: how modules can share information with each other

Some components, such ./dashboardApi/index.js, can request information from other components. In the case of dashboardApi, it can attempt to get all information that other components wish to expose on a dashboard. For example, Chat may want to expose the current total number of messages, and Authentication may wish to expose the total number of user account.

You can _invoke_ plugins like this:

    app.invokePlugin('dashboardApi', 'all', function(component, result) {
      console.log(component + ' responds:');
      console.log(result);
    });

Indeed this is what DashboardApi does.

In this case, the system will look in each of its components, including its dependencies, for files that look like:

    ./app/code/*/plugins/dashboardApi/all.js

For example ./app/code/chat/plugins/dashboardApi/all.js fits the bill, as does ./app/code/authentication/plugins/dashboardApi/all.js, but there could eventually be others.

### Components can define classes

Some components, such as dashboardApi, can define classes:

* ./app/code/dashboardApi/src/dashboardSingleNumber.js
* ./app/code/dashboardApi/src/dashboardElement.js

Objects of these classes can be created by calling a very primitive autoloader:

    const dashboardSingleNumber = app.class('dashboardApi/dashboardSingleNumber');
    const myObject = new dashboardSingleNumber('hello', 100);
    myObject.getTitle();
    // hello
    myObject.getNumber();
    // 100

### Observers
    Observers are like event handlers. When events are published, subscribers that are listening for that specific event should be triggered.
    Example:

    When we receive a WhatsApp message, we publish the messageHasBeenReceived event. The webhookWhatsAppSubscriber handles the event via the processReceivedMessage method to save the received message and send a reply.

    To publish an event:
    ```
    // Publish the event for a specific event type.
    // Call this in a event handler method of a specific class.
    // Ex:- helloWorld method of observerExamplePublisher/index.js .
    await this.app().c('observer').publish(
        // The publisher module
        'publisherModule',
        // The event being published
        'publishedEvent',
        // The event data (preferably an object instead of an empty string)
        data
    );
    ```

    To subscribe to an event:
    ```
    // Subscribe to an event handler
    await this.app().c('observer').subscribe(
        // The publisher module
        '<publisherModule>',
        // The event to listen for
        '<publishedEvent>',
        // The subscriber module
        '<subscriberModule>',
        // The method to handle the event
        '<subscriberMethod>',
        // Optional: Subscription ID (if provided, it ensures only one
        // subscriber with that ID can be added)
        subscriptionId = ''
    );
    ```
        Note: Refer to app/code/observerExamplePublisher and app/code/observerExampleSubscriber for examples of how to use the publisher and subscriber.


Operations in scripts/node-cli.sh Console

1. List all subscribers:
```
// Get all subscribers
await app.c('observer').getAllObservers();
```
2. Delete an observer by ID:
```
// Delete an observer by its ID
await app.c('observer').deleteObserverByID(observerId);
```

Steps for Testing Observers:
--------
1. **Open Node CLI**:
   First, you need to access the Node CLI by running the following command:
   ```
   ./scripts/node-cli.sh
   ```

2. **Subscribe to the Event**:
   You are subscribing to the `helloWorld` event from the `observerExamplePublisher` by calling `app.c('observer').subscriber()` multiple times.

   Here's the code for subscribing to the event:
   ```
   // subscriber1 subscribing to helloWorld publishedEvent
   app.c('observer').subscribe(
         'observerExamplePublisher',
         'helloWorld',
         'observerExampleSubscriber',
         'subscriber1'
   );

   // subscriber1 subscribing to helloWorld publishedEvent
   app.c('observer').subscribe(
         'observerExamplePublisher',
         'helloWorld',
         'observerExampleSubscriber',
         'subscriber1'
   );

   // subscriber1 subscribing to helloWorld publishedEvent
   app.c('observer').subscribe(
         'observerExamplePublisher',
         'helloWorld',
         'observerExampleSubscriber',
         'subscriber1'
   );
   ```

   In this case, you are trying to subscribe `subscriber1` three times to the `helloWorld` event, which will result in `subscriber1` handler being called only once when the event is published. That is because if you aren't provided any unique subscriptionId we are creating unique
   subscriptionId for each subscriber with using  publisherModule publisherEvent subscriberModule subscriberMethod values and we are not storing duplicate subscriberId to db.

3. **Publish the Event**:
   After subscribing, you need to trigger the event using the `helloWorld` method from the `observerExamplePublisher`:
   ```javascript
   await app.c('observerExamplePublisher').helloWorld();
   ```

   This will cause the event to be published, triggering the subscribers' handlers.

4. **Exit the CLI**:
   After publishing the event, you can exit the CLI.

5. **Verify the Logs**:
   To ensure that the event was correctly published and received, check the logs by running:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs node
   ```

   You should see the following output in the logs:
   ```
   hello
   world
   ```

### Explanation:
- **Subscribing multiple times**: Since `subscriber1` subscribes three times, its callback will be invoked once when the event is triggered.
- **Event Flow**: The flow goes like this:
   1. The publisher (`observerExamplePublisher`) triggers the `helloWorld` event.
   2. The subscriber (`observerExampleSubscriber`, `subscriber1`) listens for the event.
   3.  Subscriber to the event triggers a corresponding callback, so you should see `"hello"` printed one time.
   4. `"world"` printed once from suscriber2 which is already insert to observer collection from observer observerExampleSubscriber module.

This approach helps test how multiple subscriptions work with the observer pattern in your application.

Tokens System
----

Each user account should have unlimited tokens for specific purposes.

For example,

user A might have a token to log in which looks like a85513, and can be used to log in without a password.

user B might have a token which looks like vWnu9aYcZpAHZaZBTQvPZRgsMwkgsMwk and can be used access an API system and read user information, but not create new users. It never expires.

In tokens module we are creating new tokens and validating tokens functionality.

To generate a new token, you can use the newToken method.

```
await app.c('tokens').newToken({
    name: '<token name>',
    permissions: ['some-permission', 'another-permission'],
    whatever: 'hello world',
    _length: 6, // legth of a token
    _digits_only: false // _digits_only is false then it will include strings, if true then tokens will have only digits
  });
```

To verify the validity of a token (check if it matches its hash), you can use:

```
await app.c('tokens').checkToken(<token name>, <token>);

```
if it returns true then token valid, if null then records not found.


You can Test functionality in ./scripts/node-cli.sh:-

1. Create and store token string of length 6 and its hash.
```
> await app.c('tokens').newToken({
    name: 'something',
    permissions: ['some-permission', 'another-permission'],
    whatever: 'hello world',
    _length: 6,
    _digits_only: false
  });

```
it will return string of length 6 as a token as a response.

```
await app.c('tokens').checkToken('something', '<replace token here>');
```
it will return true i.e.. token is valid.


```
await app.c('tokens').checkToken('something', '<some value>');
```
it will return null i.e.. no record found for that token.


2. Create and store 6 digits token and its hash.

```
  await app.c('tokens').newToken({
    name: 'something',
    permissions: ['some-permission', 'another-permission'],
    whatever: 'hello world',
    _length: 6,
    _digits_only: true
  });
```
it will return 6 digits token as a response.

```
  await app.c('tokens').checkToken('something', '<replace token here>');
```
it will return true i.e.. token is valid.

```
  await app.c('tokens').checkToken('something', '522559');
```
it will get null i.e.. no record found for that token.

tokens expire after a given time
------

    You can verify token expiry functionality for login with phone number token by setting tokenExpiryDuration for ./userPhoneNumberAuth/index.js in app/config/versioned.yml.

    currently tokenExpiryDuration duration is set to 3 seconds for phone number login.
    If tokenExpiryDuration duration is 0 then token never expires.

    add/update tokenExpiryDuration in app/config/versioned.yml

    example :- 
    ./userPhoneNumberAuth/index.js:
    # user phone number login token expiry duration in 5 seconds.
        tokenExpiryDuration: 5

    and run ./scripts/deploy.sh


    go to http://0.0.0.0:8428/login-with-phone-number and fill the form , click on generate token, wait for 5 seconds and then fill the token which you received and submit the form.

    It will redirect to login page with error message
    "Invalid or expired token. Please try again." which means token is expired.

    You can also verify tokens expiry in node-cli.sh

        const tokenObject = {
            name: 'test',
            permissions: ['some-permission', 'another-permission'],
            whatever: 'hello world',
            _length: 6,
            _digits_only: false,
            };
        const token = await app.c('tokens').newToken(tokenObject, 5);
        console.log(token);
        // verify token
        await app.c('tokens').checkToken('test', token);
        // true
        // try to verify token expiry after 5 seconds
        const delay = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
        await delay(6000);
        await app.c('tokens').checkToken('test', token);
        // false



The Node.js command line interface (CLI)
-----

There are two ways to interact with Node.js:

### The sandbox CLI

Whether or not your application has been started using ./scripts/deploy.sh (see Quickstart, above), you can type:

    docker compose run --rm node /bin/sh -c 'node'

This allows you to test Javascript in isolation and does not interact with your running application. The simplest example is running:

    1 + 1;

### The app CLI

If you want to run code against your running application once you have deployed it (see Quickstart, above), thus having access to your database, as well as any information stored in memory by your app's process, you can use the app CLI:

    ./scripts/node-cli.sh

We achieve this using the Node REPL (see the Resources section below for further reading on the technical aspects of this).

To demonstrate this, you can first log into your application using the credentials provided after running the ./scripts/deploy.sh, at http://0.0.0.0:8428, and you will see something like:

> User(s) currently online: 1

The purpose of the app CLI is to have access to this information in your running application instance. Here is how.

    ./scripts/node-cli.sh

    app.component('./numUsers/index.js').numUsers();

This should give you the same number of users online as you see in the web interface.

## Piping commands to the CLI

You can **pipe** commands to the cli, like this:

    echo 'app.c("random").random()' | ./scripts/node-cli.sh

Getting logs
-----

If in your code you use something like:

    console.log('hello');

Then you can access this by running:

    docker compose logs node

MongoDB crud (create - read - update - delete)
-----

To create a record with {hello: "world"} in a collection "arbitraryCollection" in a database called "arbitraryDatabase", you can log into the node CLI (see above) and type:

    await app.c('database').client().db('arbitraryDatabase').collection('arbitraryCollection').insert({hello: "world"});
    {
      acknowledged: true,
      insertedCount: 1,
      insertedIds: { '0': new ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3") }
    }

Now you can, in a separate terminal window, log into the Mongo CLI and see what happened:

    ./scripts/mongo-cli.sh

Show databases by running:

    show dbs;
    ...
    arbitraryDatabase  0.000GB
    ...

    use arbitraryDatabase
    switched to db arbitraryDatabase

    show collections;
    arbitraryCollection

    db.arbitraryCollection.find();
    { "_id" : ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3"), "hello" : "world" }

The ID will be different in your case but let's assume that it is 634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3.

In your Node.js code, if you know the ID, you can find your record by running:

    const ObjectId  = require('mongodb').ObjectID;
    await app.c('database').client().db('arbitraryDatabase').collection('arbitraryCollection').find({_id: ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3")}).toArray();
    [ { _id: new ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3"), hello: 'world' } ]

If you want to find all records where 'hello' == 'world', you can run:

    await app.c('database').client().db('arbitraryDatabase').collection('arbitraryCollection').find({hello: "world"}).toArray();
    [ { _id: new ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3"), hello: 'world' } ]

If you want to attach some arbitrary information to record 634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3, you can run:

    /** if ObjectId is already defined do not redefine it here **/
    const ObjectId  = require('mongodb').ObjectID;
    await app.c('database').client().db('arbitraryDatabase').collection('arbitraryCollection').updateOne({_id: ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3")}, {$set:{some_extra_information: {arbitrary: "extra information"}}});

The "$set" property tells mongoDB that we want to add information to the record.

Now, if you go back to the terminal window where you are connected to the MongoDB CLI, you can run:

    db.arbitraryCollection.find();
    { "_id" : ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3"), "hello" : "world", "some_extra_information" : { "arbitrary" : "extra information" } }

You can also update collections not by ID but by property, for example:

    await app.c('database').client().db('arbitraryDatabase').collection('arbitraryCollection').updateMany({hello: "world"}, {$set:{yet_more_extra_information: {arbitrary: "extra information"}}});

Now, in the command line for MongoDB, you will find:

    db.arbitraryCollection.find();
    { "_id" : ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3"), "hello" : "world", "some_extra_information" : { "arbitrary" : "extra information" }, "yet_more_extra_information" : { "arbitrary" : "extra information" } }

We can now remove all this information in the Node CLI:

    await app.c('database').client().db('arbitraryDatabase').collection('arbitraryCollection').updateMany({hello: "world"}, {$unset:{yet_more_extra_information: "", some_extra_information: ""}});

Now the extra fields are gone in the MongoDB CLI:

    db.arbitraryCollection.find();
    { "_id" : ObjectId("634447e509ac94b6c97ecac3"), "hello" : "world" }

To completely delete the object you can run, in the Node CLI:

    await app.c('database').client().db('arbitraryDatabase').collection('arbitraryCollection').deleteMany({hello: "world"});

Now confirm these are deleted in the MongoDB CLI:

    db.arbitraryCollection.find();
    # Nothing found

Mongoose vs MongoDB
-----

We use both npm [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) and npm [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb).

Mongodb is very unstructured and lets you do almost anything; we use it in the above example. Mongoose allows you to define schemas and is used for user storage. I find its learning curve a lot steeper (I still don't fully understand it), but the code works for storing users; and it was taken from the resources in the "Resrouces" section, below.

Logging in with GitHub
-----

It is possible to log in with GitHub.

Here is how it works:

* Make sure you have a publicly-accessible, https domain, for example https://www.example.com.
* Make sure you have a GitHub account
* Fill in the form at https://github.com/settings/applications/new
  * Application name: 'MY APPLICATION NAME'
  * Application URL: https://www.example.com
  * Application description: 'MY APPLICATION DESCRIPTION'.
  * Authorization callback URL: https://www.example.com/auth/github/callback
  * Enable device flow: not enabled.
* Generate a new client secret and take note of the client ID and client secret.
* Make sure you have a file called ./app/config/unversioned.yml; in the file, have a section with your client id and secret:

```
# This can be used for API keys or anything which differs from one
# environment to another.
---
modules:
  ./loginWithGitHub/index.js:
    client: 'client_id'
    secret: 'secret'
    baseUrl: 'https://www.example.com'
```

Now go to https://www.example.com/auth/github and you will be able to log in with GitHub.

GitHub Apps
-----

Logging in with GitHub will provide access to the GitHub username, email and some other data. GitHub Apps provide acecss to a lot more data, for example private repos.

Here is how to set up a GitHub App:

* Go to https://github.com/settings/apps/new
* Enter, as a name, "Example App"
* Check Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation
* Enter the homepage URL https://starterkit-node.dcycleproject.org
* Enter the callback URL https://starterkit-node.dcycleproject.org
* Generate a client secret
* Copy your client ID and client secret

At this point an authorization token will be provided to your app, allowing you to use the GitHub API endpoints.

For example, if you want your app to be able to access your visitors' public repositories, you can call:

    curl -u GITHUB_USERNAME:ACCESS_TOKEN "https://api.github.com/user/repos?visibility=public"

Logging in with Google
-----

It is possible to log in with Google.

Here is how it works:

* Make sure you have a publicly-accessible, https domain, for example https://www.example.com.
* Make sure you have a gmail account
* Configure the Google OAuth consent screen and setting up credentials for your application.
* While configuring Oauth consent screen in scope you have to select
.../auth/userinfo.email	(To See your primary Google Account name, email address, language preference, and profile picture with dcycleproject.org.).
* While Configuring Credential Authorization redirection add callback URL: https://www.example.com/auth/google/callback
* copy client secret and take note of the client ID and client secret from
  oauth consent screen to ./app/config/unversioned.yml.
* Make sure you have a file called ./app/config/unversioned.yml; in the file, have a section with your client id and secret:

```
# This can be used for API keys or anything which differs from one
# environment to another.
---
modules:
  ./loginWithGoogle/index.js:
    client: 'client_id'
    secret: 'secret'
    baseUrl: 'https://www.example.com'
```

### Step 7: Publish (if applicable)
- If you are ready to make your app available to all users, return to the **OAuth consent screen** and click **Publish App**.

Account framework
-----

The account framework merges the IDs from the userInfo collections into the userIds field of the Account framework collection. If a user signs up with GitHub, Google, a phone number, or a username, a separate entry is created for the same user in the userInfo collections. Now, in the Account framework module, we are merging, unmerging, and fetching details of the IDs from the userInfo collection for different types logins of the same user.

Let's say a user logs in with GitHub, then Google, then a phone number. It should be possible to merge these accounts through the Account framework APIs, so that no matter which account they log in with, it will always be the same account.

    Example:

    In Browser 1: Let's create an account using the phone number 1234567:

        Go to http://0.0.0.0:8428/login
        Click "Login with phone number"
        Enter 1234567
        Select "Internal"
        Click "Generate token"

        Run ./scripts/uli.sh in the terminal to generate a username and password.

    Now, in another browser:

    In Browser 2:

        Go to http://0.0.0.0:8428/login
        Enter the username and password to log in
        You should see a token in the chat
        In Browser 1, enter the token to log in with the phone number.
        Click "Submit."

    Now, in Browser 2, it should say: "Welcome <username>" (the username generated in the terminal). In Browser 1, it should say: "Welcome 1234567."

    This happens because there are two separate accounts in the system:

Let's say that the user "admin" and the user "1234567" are, in fact, the same person, and they want to log in either with their phone number or with their username and password.

Now, with the help of the Account framework, we can merge these accounts.

For example, if you want to merge two accounts: one with a username and the other with a phone login.

In nodec-cli.sh, try to merge the two userInfo IDs as follows.


> await app.c('accountFramework').merge('679cab8c2c8c9642d2d862b1', '679ce2347d8a5b31b1df6a77');


Now, in mongo-cli.sh, you can see that the userIds are merged in the accountframeworks collection.


    db.accountframeworks.find();

    { "_id" : ObjectId("679e4bd779cea8c463197127"), "userIds" : [ ObjectId("679c5b56126a8ab71deaad0f"), ObjectId("679c5ce4f6469177ef7ecb43") ], "__v" : 5 }



Now, in mongo-cli.sh, if you try to fetch the details of user ID 679c5b56126a8ab71deaad0f, you will see details of both userInfo documents.


> await app.c('accountFramework').getAccounts('679c5b56126a8ab71deaad0f');
>
[
    {
        _id: new ObjectId('679c5b56126a8ab71deaad0f'),
        username: 'admin',
        createdAt: 2025-01-31T10:53:04.530Z,
        updatedAt: 2025-02-01T14:35:38.593Z,
        __v: 0
    },
    {
        _id: new ObjectId('679c5ce4f6469177ef7ecb43'),
        username: '1234567',
        createdAt: 2025-01-31T14:46:13.845Z,
        updatedAt: 2025-01-31T14:46:13.845Z,
        __v: 0,
        phoneNumber: '1234567'
    }
]

The getAccounts method tries to filter userIDs field from the account framework collection. If no documents are found, it will query the user info collection to retrieve user details. If no matching documents are found there either, it will return an empty array.

If you don't want to merge the accounts, you can unmerge the userIds.

In nodec-cli.sh, unmerge the userId 679c5ce4f6469177ef7ecb43.


> await app.c('accountFramework').unmerge('679c5ce4f6469177ef7ecb43');


Now, in mongo-cli.sh, you can see that the userIds are unmerged in the accountframeworks collection.



    db.accountframeworks.find();

    { "_id" : ObjectId("679e4bd779cea8c463197127"), "userIds" : [ ObjectId("679c5b56126a8ab71deaad0f") ], "__v" : 2 }

    { "_id" : ObjectId("679e4c2179cea8c463197136"), "userIds" : [ ObjectId("679c5ce4f6469177ef7ecb43") ], "__v" : 0 }



Merge and Unmerge accounts through UI.
------------------------------------

    Suppose you want to merge your github login account with username password login account.

    In browser 1 login from your username password login account.

    go to /account/merge

    click on GENERATE A TOKEN BUTTON and copy the token.

    token format < user id of username password login account >:<token with length 12>
    token expiry duration : 1 hour

    In browser 2 login using your github login account.

    go to /account/merge

    Paste token into token input textbox and click MERGE button you will see popup and click yes, merge button .
    Upon successful merge you will see

    ```
    "Your account is a merger of the following accounts"

    "* <name of your username password login account>"
    "* <name of your github login account >"

    [UNMERGE THIS ACCOUNT]

    "To merge an account into this account, enter a merge token that you got from another account"

    [         ] ENTER MERGE TOKEN HERE

    "To merge this account into another account, generate a token and enter it into the other account"

    [GENERATE A TOKEN BUTTON]
    ```

    Now in browser 1 refresh /account/merge page you will see

    ```
    "Your account is a merger of the following accounts"

    "* <name of your username password login account>"
    "* <name of your github login account >"

    [UNMERGE THIS ACCOUNT]

    "To merge an account into this account, enter a merge token that you got from another account"

    [         ] ENTER MERGE TOKEN HERE

    "To merge this account into another account, generate a token and enter it into the other account"

    [GENERATE A TOKEN BUTTON]
    ```

    If you wan to UNMERGE the accounts.

    click on [UNMERGE THIS ACCOUNT] button to unmerge the account. you will see popup and click yes, unmerge button . Upon success you will see

    ```
    "Your account is not merged with any other account"

    "To merge an account into this account, enter a merge token that you got from another account"

    [ ] ENTER MERGE TOKEN HERE

    "To merge this account into another account, generate a token and enter it into the other account"

    [GENERATE A TOKEN BUTTON]
    ````

Merge and Unmerge accounts through Shell.
------------------------------------

1. Merge accounts by username :- 
```
./scripts/account-merge.sh <username1> <username2>
```

ex:- ./scripts/account-merge.sh c d


2. Account Information by username:- 
```
./scripts/account-info.sh <username>
```

ex:- ./scripts/account-info.sh c

3. Unmerge account by username:- 

```
./scripts/account-unmerge.sh <username>
```

ex:- ./scripts/account-unmerge.sh c


Security tokens
-----

Security tokens are used to access data, notably via the REST API.

Tokens are generated in one of two ways.

### By logging in to a web page and requesting a token using the token request endpoint

If you are logged in to the system, you can visit this URL:

    /token/request

It will give you a token that lasts 5 minutes.

You can check a token's validity by logging in and running:

    /token/check-valid?token=MY_TOKEN

This will tell you whether the token is valid or not, and why.

### By using the node CLI or in node code

All tokens need to be associated with a user.

To find your user ID, you can log into the Mongo CLI:

    ./scripts/mongo-cli.sh

And run:

    db.userInfo.find();

To create a token for a given user for 60 seconds, log into the node cli:

    ./scripts/node-cli.sh

And run:

    app.c('token').token('some-user-id', 60, {arbitrary: 'options'})

You can verify that the token is valid by typing:

    await app.c('token').tokenStringToObject(t).toObjectAboutValidity();

Tokens are not revocable.

REST API
-----

A REST API is defined at the following endpoing:

    /api/v1

If you simply visit /api/v1, you will see documentation about the API.

Only endpoints that publicly accessible are currently supported, for example:

    /api/v1/endpoints

Access to content by permission
-----
Sometimes, only certain authenticated users should have access to certain content.
That's what the restrictedByPermission module does. Here's how it works.

By default files of app/private/restricted-by-permission/permission-{permissionId}/access/* folder are restrcited to authenticated user and anonymous user. If you try to access restricted by permission folders then app/private/restricted-by-permission/permission-{permissionId}/no-access/index.html content will be displayed with 403 status.

If admin or any authenticated user wants to access files for example:- app/private/restricted-by-permission/permission-xyz/access/index.html or app/private/restricted-by-permission/permission-xyz/access/styles.css .... then we have to assign a permission to the
respective user based on permissionId.

permissionId should be the part after pemission- in folder name.
example:- from above example  permission-xyz/access/* is the restricted folder, `xyz` is the permission id.

By running below command in terminal, you are giving permission to admin to access permission-xyz/access/* folder.
```
    ./scripts/node-cli.sh
    // Load admin user.
    const u = await app.c('authentication').user('admin');
    // Enable permission to access files of permission-xyz folder.
    app.c('authentication').userFieldValue(u, 'view-content-permission-xyz', '1');
```

With this admin can access files of folder permission-xyz/access.

Disable permission to user:- Run below command to remove permission to access files of permission-xyz/access folder for admin user.

```
    ./scripts/node-cli.sh
    // Load admin user.
    const u = await app.c('authentication').user('admin');
    // Remove permission to access files of permission-xyz folder.
    app.c('authentication').userFieldValue(u, 'view-content-permission-xyz', '0');
```

Whatsapp Message Send/Recieve Functionality
-----

**Send WhatsApp Message:**

To send a WhatsApp message, ensure the following environment variables are present and valid in the `.env` file:

- `TWILIO_USER`
- `TWILIO_PASS`
- `FROM_NUM`
- `DEV_MODE`

- If `DEV_MODE=true` (development environment), the message is saved to `./unversioned/output/whatsapp-send.json`.
- If `DEV_MODE=false` (production environment), the message is sent to the specified `sendTo` number.

Ensure `DEV_MODE=true` in the development environment.

**Testing WhatsApp Message Sending Functionality in Terminal:**

1. Access the Node.js client:
   ```
   ./scripts/node-cli.sh
   ```

2. Run the following code, replacing `<country code>` and `<phone number>`:
   ```
   >> await app.c('whatsAppSend').parsepropertySendMessage('{"message": "<Message content>", "sendTo":"<country code><phone number>"}');
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   >> await app.c('whatsAppSend').parsepropertySendMessage('{"message": "This is a test message", "sendTo":"+150XXXXXXX"}');
   ```
   Sending media message:
   ```
   >> await app.c('whatsAppSend').parsepropertySendMessage('{"message": "This is a test message", "sendTo":"+150XXXXXXX","mediaUrl": "<valid url of a image or video or excel or csv >"');
   ```

**Testing WhatsApp Message Sending Functionality Using curl:**

- **In Development Environment:**
   ```
    curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"message": "This is a test message000", "sendTo": "+XXXXXXXXXX"}' \
         http://0.0.0.0:8792/whatsappmessage/send/<AUTH_API_TOKEN>

   ```

- **In Production Environment:**
   ```
        curl -X POST \
           -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
           --data '{"message": "This is a test message", "sendTo": "+XXXXXXXXXX"}' \
           https://<DOMAIN-NAME>/whatsappmessage/send/<AUTH_API_TOKEN>
   ```
    modify message and sendTo according to your requirement.

    * If you are a authorised user then access .env and copy AUTH_API_TOKEN value and replace in above command.

- **Sending media message :**

    ```
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"message": "<media caption message or leave empty>", "sendTo": "+91XXXXXXXXXX","mediaUrl": "<valid url of a image or video or excel or csv >"}' <base url>/whatsappmessage/send/<AUTH_API_TOKEN>
    ```

**Receive WhatsApp Message:**

Whenever a WhatsApp message is sent to the `FROM_NUM` number, it is saved to `./unversioned/output/whatsapp.json`. If the message's account SID equals to `TWILIO_USER`, then the message saved to the `whatsappmessages` collection in the database.

You can verify whether the message is saved to the database:

1. Send a message:
   ```
   WHATSAPP_TO=[PUT YOUR WHATSAPP NUMBER HERE]

   cd ~/whatsapp-communication
   curl "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/${TWILIO_USER}/Messages.json" -X POST \
   --data-urlencode "To=whatsapp:${WHATSAPP_TO}" \
   --data-urlencode "From=whatsapp:${FROM_NUM}" \
   --data-urlencode 'Body=This is a reply' \
   -u ${TWILIO_USER}:${TWILIO_PASS}
   ```

2. In a separate terminal window, log into the Mongo CLI and check what happened:
   ```
   ./scripts/mongo-cli.sh

   Show databases by running:
   ```
   ```
   show dbs;
   ...
   arbitraryDatabase  0.000GB
   ...

   use arbitraryDatabase
   switched to db arbitraryDatabase

   show collections;
   arbitraryCollection

   db.whatsappmessages.find();
   ```

    Verify your message record exist.

Send SMS
-----

To send a sms ensure the following environment variables are present and valid in the `.env` file:

- `TWILIO_USER`
- `TWILIO_PASS`
- `FROM_NUM`
- `DEV_MODE`

- If `DEV_MODE=true` (development environment), the sms is saved to `./unversioned/output/sms-send.json`.
- If `DEV_MODE=false` (production environment), the sms is sent to the specified `sendTo` number.

Ensure `DEV_MODE=true` in the development environment.

**Testing SMS Sending Functionality in Terminal:**

1. Access the Node.js client:
   ```
   ./scripts/node-cli.sh
   ```

2. Run the following code, replacing `<country code>` and `<phone number>`:
   ```
   >> await app.c('sendSMS').parsepropertySendSMS('{"message": "<Message content>", "sendTo":"<country code><phone number>"}');
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   >> await app.c('sendSMS').parsepropertySendSMS('{"message": "This is a test message", "sendTo":"+150XXXXXXX"}');
   ```

**Testing SMS Sending Functionality Using curl:**

- **In Development Environment:**
   ```
    curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"message": "This is a test message000", "sendTo": "'"+XXXXXXXXXX"'"}' \
         http://0.0.0.0:8792/sms/send/<AUTH_API_TOKEN>

   ```

- **In Production Environment:**

           https://<DOMAIN-NAME>/sms/send/<AUTH_API_TOKEN>
   ```
    modify message and sendTo according to your requirement.

    * If you are a authorised user then access .env and copy AUTH_API_TOKEN value and replace in above command.

Typechecking
-----

In January, 2024, we moved away from using [Flow](https://flow.org) and moved to the approach described in [Using Typescript without compilation, by Pascal Schilp, dev.to, Mar 26, 2023](https://dev.to/thepassle/using-typescript-without-compilation-3ko4) and [Type Safe JavaScript with JSDoc, by TruckJS, Medium, Sep. 4, 2018](https://medium.com/@trukrs/type-safe-javascript-with-jsdoc-7a2a63209b76).

For this we are using <https://github.com/dcycle/docker-typescript>.

The reasons are:

* I prefer the syntax of Typescript/JSDoc to the unweildy syntax of Flow.
* Flow seems to require type definitions, whereas Typescript will surmise type definitions if they don't exist.

The chatbot framework
-----

    await app.c('chatbot')
      .chat({
        plugin: 'calculator',
        text: '2+2',
      });

This should return:

    {
      result: 4,
      conversationId: '47388896-c8fd-400f-b123-0a9e16ea171f',
    }

Then we can do

    await app.c('chatbot')
      .chat({
        conversationId: '47388896-c8fd-400f-b123-0a9e16ea171f',
        text: '+5',
    });

This should return:

    {
      result: 9,
      conversationId: '47388896-c8fd-400f-b123-0a9e16ea171f',
    }

If we do

    await app.c('chatbot')
      .chat({
        plugin: 'this-plugin-does-not-exist',
        text: '2+2',
      });

This should return:

    {
      errors: [
        'Plugin this-plugin-does-not-exist does not exist',
      ],
    }

If we do

    await app.c('chatbot')
      .chat({
        text: '2+2',
      });

This should return:

    {
      errors: [
        'Specify either a plugin or a conversationId',
      ],
    }

The textFramework
-----

We have four (4) text new modules:

textFramework
textFrameworkWhatsApp
textFrameworkSMS
textFrameworkInternal

textFrameworkWhatsApp, textFrameworkSMS, textFrameworkInternal are GLUE between the textFramework modules and the existing whatsAppSend, sendSms, and chat modules.

In our ./app/config/versioned.yml file, we have enabled all 4 modules

./textFramework/index.js:
  plugins:
    whatsapp:
      name: whatsapp
      plugin: textFrameworkWhatsApp
    sms:
      name: sms
      plugin: textFrameworkSMS
    internal:
      name: internal
      plugin: textFrameworkInternal
./textFrameworkWhatsApp/index.js:
./textFrameworkSMS/index.js:
./textFrameworkInternal/index.js:

Now we can send messages through textFramework by specifying respective plugins in node cli.

./scripts/node-cli.sh

```
    await app.c('textFramework').sendText({plugin: 'sms', message: 'hello', sendTo: '+<your phone number>' })

    await app.c('textFramework').sendText({plugin: 'whatsapp', message: 'hello', sendTo: '+<your phone number>' })

    await app.c('textFramework').sendText({plugin: 'internal', message: 'hello', name: 'my name' })
```


Troubleshooting

### ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached

In some cases you might run into an issue where you cannot successfully start the node service. `docker compose logs node` might give you an error which looks like:

```
ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached
```

If such is the case you might want to increase the number of file watchers *on the Docker host machine*.

To see how many file watchers you have:

* On mac OS, run `sysctl kern.maxfiles`. On my system I get `kern.maxfiles: 491520`.
* On Ubuntu, run `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches`. On DigitalOcean I was getting 8192, which worked fine with a single instance of a Node Starterkit-based app, however when I tried to create a new one app, I was getting ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached.

To increase the number of file watchers, for example, to 524288 ([this number comes from a comment from user wellsman on a GitHub issue](https://github.com/coder/code-server/issues/628#issuecomment-636526989), and the number 524288 appears a lot in different sources pertaining to this issue, however it's not clear whence this precise number comes). In any event this works on Ubuntu:

    echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    sudo sysctl -p

Again, it is important to do this on your Docker host, not on the container!




Integrate Stripe subscriptions
-----

Step 1. Configure Products, Get Api Keys from Stripe dashboard.

Step 2. Integrate and run stripe subscription in starterkit-node.


Step 1. Configure Products, Get Api Keys from Stripe dashboard.
-----

Step 1:- Create a account in stripe dashboard 

Fill this form [https://dashboard.stripe.com/register ](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register ) to create a stripe account. You will receive email for email verification. Verify email by clicking on verification email, Upon success page will get redirect to stripe dashboard.


Step 2:- Get api keys 

Go to  [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)  you will see publishable and secured key are generated for your account. Publishable keys for test environment starts with pk_test and secured keys for test environment are starts with sk_test. 

Note down both the keys.


Step 3 : We have to create Subscription based products.  

Click on subscriptions in left side pane or visit [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions)

We don't see any subscriptions . Because we haven't created products yet. Click on Create product or go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products?active=true&create=product&source=product_list](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products?active=true&create=product&source=product_list)

create product one by one.

    example :- 

    Subscription Product 1:- Basic, 10$/m 

        name: Basic ,
        Enter description (optional)
        Image (optional)
        **** In pricing section select Recurring, Since it is a subscription based products requires monthly/yearly/custom renewals ***
        Enter Amount 10 and select currency USD
        Billing period: monthly (you can change it according to your requirement) 
        Click on create product. 

    Subscription Product 2:- Advanced, 20$/m

        Repeat as specified in example 1. 

    Subscription Product 3. Pro, 30$/m

        Repeat as specified in example 1. 


Now that we have created subscription based products.


Step 2. Integrate and run stripe subscription in starterkit-node.
---------

step1:-  nodejs stripe package heps us to access stripe api, we have included stripe in package.json.

step2:-  Open app/config/unversioned.yml file and 
    register a  /stripeSubscriptions/index.js module with stripeSecurityKey and stripePublishableKey. 

```
./stripeSubscriptions/index.js:
    stripeSecurityKey: '<replace your stripe secure key copied earlier>'
    stripePublishableKey: '<replace your stripe publishable key copied earlier>'

```

stripeSecurityKey :-  secret Stripe API key required for the Stripe library, which is necessary for authenticating API requests.

stripePublishableKey :-  Publishable keys which is used for client-side operations (e.g., for creating a Stripe checkout or other interactions with the Stripe API that are intended to happen in the browser). Publishable keys are safe to use on the front end.


step3:-  Deploy the code

    ```
    $ ./scripts/deploy.sh  . 
    ```
    create user a and b and note down their passwords. 

    ```
    ./scripts/reset-password.sh a
    ./scripts/reset-password.sh b
    ```

Step 4:- Login as user a 

-    go to  /add/payment-method and fill card number, date, CVV, zip code and click on enter payment details 


      *** For test environment payment method values *** 
      card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
      Future date: 12/34
      CVV: Any 3 digit number
      Zip code: Any 5 digit number
      

-    page will redirect to /account/subscriptions/add subscription plan page. You can see the products created in stripe dashboard are displayed here.  products are fetch directly from stripe using publishable api key from front end (We are not storing products in starterkit node).

-    select the subscription plan and click on subscribe. 
Page will redirect to /account/subscriptions Subscriptions page.  Here you can see your subscribed products details fetched directly from stripe. If your account is merged with other account then you can see currently log in and merged accounts subscribed products (We are not storing subscriptions in starterkit node). 

-    You can click on cancel subscribe to cancel the subscription.

-    You can login to stripe dashboard and verify customer, transactions, subscriptions , invoices  . 
 [https://dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)

Summary :- 

*** stripe expects customer details like customer email, his metadata like username ... are to be sent to stripe system.  If customer email id is sent to stripe then stripe will send emails regarding orders and other activities. 

***Stripe doesn't let us subscribe to products unless we send a payment method id of a respective customer If it is a subscription type products.

* Hence first we have to create customer and attach payment method to customer in stripe through api.  when currently logged in user submits payment method in  /add/payment-method page. we are checking stripe customer is already created and customer id , payment method id , currently logged in user id is stored in stripeCustomer collection. If not when payment method id successfully returned from stripe, we are storing customer id, payment method id , currently logged in user id  in stripeCustomer collection for future reference.

* when user click on subscribe a product we have to send customer id, payment method id and price id of a selected product price item to subscribe in stripe through api end point. 

* In subscription listing page we are fetching merged account userIds. Foreach userId finding out customer id from stripeCustomer collections and then by passing customer id we are fetching subscription details and rending the subscriptions details and product associated with it  from stripe endpoint. 

* For Cancel the subscription We can send subscriptionId to stripe cancel api to cancel the subscription.
